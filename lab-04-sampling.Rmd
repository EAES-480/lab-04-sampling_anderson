# Overview

## What is AmeriFlux?

**AmeriFlux** is a network of **eddy covariance** flux-tower sites that measure exchanges of **carbon (CO₂), water, and energy** between ecosystems and the atmosphere, with standardized data products shared for research and education.

In this lab, you will use a simplified AmeriFlux-style dataset from the **US-AMS site at Argonne National Laboratory (near Chicago)**. The measurements are at **30-minute resolution** over **2023**, and show strong **seasonality** and **day–night cycles**.

**Key idea for this lab:** treat the full 2023 time series as the **population**, then practice sampling strategies to estimate population parameters.

# Learning goals

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Define a **population** and a **sample** for an EAES time-series dataset
- Compute population **parameters** (mean, SD) and compare to sample **estimates**
- Visualize distributions and identify **latent grouping variables** (month, day/night)
- Implement **simple random sampling** and **stratified sampling**
- Use `set.seed()` to make sampling reproducible

---

# Data

## Load and inspect

```{r load_data, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
df <- read_csv("data/us-ams-simple.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>% filter(year_local == 2023)

glimpse(df)
```

**CHECK:** You should see columns like `year_local`, `doy`, `daytime`, and flux/biomet variables (e.g., `gpp`, `fc`, `le`, `ta`).

---

## Create a date and month column from DOY

This dataset uses **Year + Day-of-Year (DOY)**. Month must be derived from a calendar date.

```{r derive_time, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    # TODO: create a Date column from year_local and doy
    # HINT: Jan 1 is DOY = 1, so use (doy - 1) with origin = "YYYY-01-01"
    date = as.Date(doy - 1, origin = paste0(2023, "-01-01")),

    # TODO: create a month column (numeric 1–12 or labeled months)
    month = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE),

    # TODO: make a day/night label using daytime (0/1)
    day_night = if_else(daytime == 1, "Day", "Night")
  )

count(df, month)
count(df, day_night)
```

---

# Choose a response variable

You will analyze **one response variable** throughout the lab. This could be a CO₂ flux metric or a meteorological variable.

Examples you can choose from (depending on what you see in the dataset):
- CO₂ / carbon: `gpp`, `reco`, `fc`
- Energy: `le`
- Meteorology: `ta`, `ts`, `swc`

```{r choose_response, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
# TODO: choose ONE response variable (a column name as a string)
response_var <- "ta"   # replace "gpp" with your choice, e.g. "fc" or "le" or "ta"

# CHECK: print a quick summary
df %>% summarise(
  n = n(),
  n_missing = sum(is.na(ta)),
  mean = mean(ta, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd = sd(ta, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

**Prompt (2–3 sentences):** Why did you choose this response variable? What do you expect its seasonality/day–night pattern to be?

I chose this response variable because it should have a clear pattern between seasons and time of day. I expect during JJA and morning times it will be at its highest, while during DJF and evening times it should be at its lowest.

# Section 1 — Data dictionary (conceptual)

Students will populate the data dictionary using:
https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/aboutdata/data-variables/

Fill in at least **5 variables** from this dataset:

| Variable | Units | Description | Expected sign/seasonality? |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
|  ta   | deg C |air temperature|  high in summer         |
| le  |  W m-2  | latent heat |              |
| gpp | µmolCO2 m-2 s-1|gross primary productivity| high in spring/summer  |
| swc |   %  | soil water content | low in summer |
| ts  |  deg C |soil temperature |     high in summer      |

# Section 2 — Visualizing the population

Remember: for this lab, the **population** is the entire 2023 half-hourly time series.

## 2.1 Time series view

```{r plot_time_series, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
# GOAL: Visualize seasonality over the year.
# TODO: pick a y aesthetic using response_var.

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = ta)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = response_var,
    title = "Population time series (2023)"
  )
```

**Prompt (2–3 sentences):** What major patterns do you see? (Seasonal cycle? Daily cycle? Outliers?)

It seems to be dependent most on time of year. Towards the middle of the response, which would be the summer months, the data increases. 

---

## 2.2 Population distribution (histogram + density)

```{r pop_distribution, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
# GOAL: See the overall distribution of the population.
# TODO: choose an appropriate number of bins (start with ~50).

ggplot(df, aes(x = ta)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = response_var, y = "Count", title = "Population distribution (histogram)")

ggplot(df, aes(x = ta)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = response_var, y = "Density", title = "Population distribution (density)")
```

**Prompt:** Describe shape (skew, modality), center, and spread.

The distribution is bimodal, mostly symmetrical, centered around 10, and has a spread from -15-35

---

## 2.3 Do latent groups explain variability? (month, day/night)

### By month

```{r pop_by_month, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
# TODO: make month appear in a sensible order (it already is an ordered factor if label=TRUE)
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = ta)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = response_var, title = "Population by month")
```

### By day/night

```{r pop_by_daynight, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_night, y = ta)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = response_var, title = "Population by day vs night")
```

**Prompt (3–4 sentences):** Which grouping variable (month or day/night) seems to explain more variability in your response? Why?

It appears the month experiences more variability. Although the day/night shows some differences, it is much more stark in the month plot. The increase in the summer season (JJA) would cause the most variability in the response.

---

# Section 3 — Population parameters (truth)

Compute the population mean and SD for your chosen response variable.

```{r population_params, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
pop_mean <- mean(df$ta, na.rm = TRUE)
pop_sd   <- sd(df$ta, na.rm = TRUE)

tibble(
  response_var = response_var,
  population_mean = pop_mean,
  population_sd = pop_sd
)
```

---

# Section 4 — Simple random sampling (SRS)

## 4.1 One random sample

```{r one_sample, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
set.seed(480)

# TODO: choose a sample size (e.g., 200, 500, 1000)
n_samp <- 200

samp <- df %>%
  slice_sample(n = n_samp)

samp_mean <- mean(samp$ta, na.rm = TRUE)
samp_sd   <- sd(samp$ta, na.rm = TRUE)

tibble(
  n_samp = n_samp,
  sample_mean = samp_mean,
  sample_sd = samp_sd,
  pop_mean = pop_mean,
  pop_sd = pop_sd
)
```

**Prompt (2–3 sentences):** How close is your one-sample estimate to the population mean/SD? Is the difference surprising?

It is extremely similar, off by ~ 0.40. There is going to be some variability, so it isn't that surprising. 

---

## 4.2 Sampling variability: many samples → many means

```{r sampling_distribution, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
set.seed(480)

reps <- 500  # TODO: choose number of replicates (e.g., 500 or 1000)

means <- replicate(
  reps,
  df %>%
    slice_sample(n = n_samp) %>%
    summarise(m = mean(ta, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    pull(m)
)

ggplot(tibble(mean_est = means), aes(mean_est)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = pop_mean, linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1.1) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  labs(
    x = paste0("Sample mean of ", response_var),
    y = "Count",
    title = "Sampling distribution of the mean (SRS)",
    subtitle = "Dashed line = population mean"
  )
```

**Prompt (2–3 sentences):** Is the sampling distribution centered on the population mean? What happens if you increase `n_samp`?

It's closely centered on the population mean. If I were to increase `n_samp` the variability would decrease and the distribution would appear more normal.

---

# Section 5 — Stratified sampling

Here you’ll test whether stratification helps when the population has structure.

## 5.1 Stratify by month

```{r strat_by_month, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
set.seed(480)

# GOAL: sample within each month to ensure seasonal representation.
# TODO: choose n_per_month so total sample size is reasonable (e.g., 12 * 20 = 240)
n_per_month <- 15

samp_strat <- df %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  slice_sample(n = n_per_month) %>%
  ungroup()

strat_mean <- mean(samp_strat$ta, na.rm = TRUE)
strat_sd   <- sd(samp_strat$ta, na.rm = TRUE)

tibble(
  n_per_month = n_per_month,
  total_n = nrow(samp_strat),
  strat_mean = strat_mean,
  strat_sd = strat_sd,
  pop_mean = pop_mean,
  pop_sd = pop_sd
)
```

---

## 5.2 Compare strategies (SRS vs stratified)

```{r compare_sampling, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
tibble(
  strategy = c("Population", "SRS", "Stratified by month"),
  mean = c(pop_mean, samp_mean, strat_mean),
  sd   = c(pop_sd,   samp_sd,   strat_sd)
)
```

**Prompt (3–4 sentences):** Which strategy better approximated the population mean and SD for your response variable? Why might stratification help (or not) here?

Stratified by month is the better approximation. Stratification helps when the variable being stratified is related to the response variable. By dividing the population into groups, we can make sure the sample is representative of the population. This would reduce sampling error. 

---

# Section 6 — Conceptual reflection

Answer in **4–6 sentences**:

- Why does seasonality matter for sampling?
- What happens if sampling ignores latent grouping variables?
- In EAES field studies, when is stratification essential?
- What is one trade-off of stratified sampling?

Seasonality is critical in sampling because environmental characteristics and patterns shift throughout the year. This means a sample taken in one season may not represent the population in another. 
Ignoring latent grouping can result in misleading and unreliable conclusions. 
Stratification is essential in environmental and field studies when the population can be partitioned into subgroups that may have different mean values. Though, stratified sampling can be more difficult and time-consuming.

# Part II (Placeholder — to be added)

In the next lab section, we will extend this to **sampling methods in EAES** (e.g., systematic sampling, cluster sampling, sampling frames, and bias) and connect sampling to **hypothesis testing**.
